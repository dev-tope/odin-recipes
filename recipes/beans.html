    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>There are three main varieties of beans that my mom uses to make this dish: â€“ honey beans (aka oloyin beans or ewa oloyin), black eyed peas, and Nigerian brown beans. 
        The best beans to use in this recipe are the honey beans because they have a unique and slightly sweet flavor that really elevate your dish,
        but either of the other beans would do just fine. The Nigerian brown beans look almost identical to the honey beans, 
        so be sure to ask specifically for honey beans if you decide to pick it up at an African market.</p>


    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups Honey beans</li>
        <li>1/4 cup palm oil</li>

    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the beans and place in a deep pot with 7 cups of water.</li>
        <li>Boil the beans on medium heat until it becomes soft, it could take about 40 mins. If you are using black eyed peas, it might take a little longer.</li>
        <li>While the beans are boiling, blend the tomatoes, peppers, and onions and set aside</li>
        <li>Once the beans are softened from boiling (do not drain the water), turn the heat down to low, the pour in the blended tomatoes into pot.</li>
