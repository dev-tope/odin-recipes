        <li>3/4 cup of olive oil</li>
        <li>5 Tbsp Tomato Paste</li>
        <li>4 cups chicken stock</li>
        <li>1 tbsp curry powder</li>
        <li>1 tbsp thyme</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>1tbsp ginger</li>
        <li>1 tbsp salt</li>
        <li>1 Onion</li>
        <li>1 tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 tbsp seasoning powder</li>
        <li>White pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pan, preheat the cooking oil. Once the oil is hot, add the diced onions and fry for about 3 to 5 minutes or till the onions become soft.</li>
        <li>Add the Tomato Paste. Fry for about 5 minutes, then add the garlic, ginger, and bay leaves and let it cook in the tomato paste for about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the blended pepper and allow the pepper to cook until the water is reduced entirely and the oil is seen floating on the fried pepper.</li>
        <li>Season with thyme, curry powder, salt to taste, and seasoning cubes. Leave to cook for another 2 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the rice until it is well coated with the sauce. Add the Chicken stock and cover it with a tight-fitting lid, then allow it to come to a boil.</li>
        <li>Once it starts boiling - about 3 to 5 minutes after placing it on the stove, reduce the heat immediately to medium-low and steam until the rice is done.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat and add the sliced tomato and onions, and stir together briefly. Then, cover it up immediately so that the heat remaining in the rice can steam up the vegetables a little bit.</li>
        <li>You can serve with Plantains, Chicken, Vegetables or as desired. ENJOY!</li>
