    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Am I one of those people that turns everything into jollof….? Maybe. But it’s delicious, so it doesn’t really matter. 
       My goal in making this jollof spaghetti recipe was to make sure it tasted like jollof, not spaghetti and sauce, and if I have to say so myself: 
       I nailed it.
    </p>

    <p>Some people have asked me for my jollof rice recipe; to those I say, “hold please”. I, just like most other west Africans love jollof rice, 
       but sometimes, I want a quick and easy jollof flavor that does not require me making jollof rice. In came my jollof couscous that takes only 
       20 minutes to prepare. I then became low-key addicted to quick and easy jollof recipes. I have also always loved pasta, so the no-brainer next
       step was to make a jollof spaghetti. My goal in making this recipe was to make sure it tasted like jollof, not spaghetti and sauce, 
       and if I have to say so myself: I nailed it.

    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb usually one box thin spaghetti</li>
        <li>2 3/4 cup chicken stock</li>
        <li>5 large Roma tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 large onion</li>
        <li>1 large red bell pepper</li>
        <li>2 scotch bonnet pepper</li>
        <li>3 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 tsp bouillon powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried thyme</li>
        <li>1 tsp curry powder</li>
        <li>A small handful of basil options</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Blend the tomatoes, onions, and peppers until smooth.</li>
        <li>Boil down the tomato sauce on in a pot on medium- high heat until the sauce is about half the amount, and has thickened significantly to look like a paste. This takes about 15-20 minutes, depending on how high the heat is.</li>
        <li>Be sure to stir the sauce occasionally to prevent it from burning.</li>
        <li>Once the sauce is reduced, pour in the stock, oil, thyme, curry powder and bouillon. At this stage, taste the sauce and adjust for salt.</li>
        <li>Add in the spaghetti, pushing it down or breaking it to fit into the pot.</li>
        <li>Cover and allow to cook for 5 minutes on low-medium heat.</li>
        <li>After 5 minutes, the pasta should be soft enough to stir. Stir, turn down the heat to low, and allow to cook for another 8-10 minutes.</li>
        <li>After 8 minutes, stir, and the pasta should be cooked. If it is not, add in a splash (about 1/4 cup) of water and continue to cook for another 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>If you choose to add basil, add it in at this stage, and then serve.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p>When stirring the pasta, you may notice that the bottom of the pot may burn slightly, do not panic. 
       This burn gives your dish a distinct party jollof taste. Count it as a bonus privilege.</p>
